# Fashion image classification
By Belhadi Manssour & Tiouche Abderaouf
This repository is a complete framework that can provide image classification and give the right category, pose and color of input clothes images.
Our model can be improved by collecting more data and try to balance the nature of data (the number of clothes images is not the same for all classes), also deploy different CNN architectures. In addition, we aim to improve the accuracy of color recognition.

Finding the right product in the online clothing marketplace can be challenging. The
clothing marketplace visitors are overwhelmed with textual data, images, and video. These
different information types should be leveraged effectively to facilitate user navigation. Features
like researching and recommending products are becoming essential to attract more customers.
Conventionally, these features are implemented based on textual data and shallow machine
learning, making them incapable of extracting rich information from images. Besides, images are
vital in the fashion industry because customers buy clothes based on their appearance, not their
textual description.
Recently, deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art results in many fields and
particularly in computer vision tasks. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is considered the
most successful deep model used extensively in practice. In this project, our objective is to use
CNN for image classification in the clothing field. For this reason, many deep architectures are
proposed and evaluated, using huge image datasets, to assess the impact of our deep learning
methodology to automate the extraction of clothes attributes

# Conclusion 
As conclusion, it can be said that the required goals have been gracefully accomplished for the given work. The complete framework allows the user to perform clothes image classification. We can consider this project as part of a global Fashion Recommendation System project focused on a deep learning architecture. The implemented deep learning algorithm helps to identify fashion-related items in an image. To identify and classify the object, detailed image analysis, and processing is required
